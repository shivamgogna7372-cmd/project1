**\# Assignment 1: Getting Organized -- Pet Daycare Project**

**\## 1. Assumptions**

As client meetings are short and can get off track, I am preparing by
making a few assumptions based on the scenario. These assumptions will
be presented to the client to confirm their validity.

I will also create a list of assumptions and carry it during the client
meeting in the form of a checklist. Throughout the discussion, I would
note the confirmations or corrections of the clients in this checklist.
Once the meeting is over, I will change the requirements document
instantly to include validated information. This will guarantee a
traceability of initial assumptions and verified client requirements.

-   The Pet Daycare is currently utilizing manual or semi-manual
    processes (paper forms, emails, employee memory) for onboarding
    employees and clients.

-   Training of employees is non-standard, whereby every trainer trains
    differently, and this results in variability.

-   Around 3 months are needed before an employee can work independently
    without needing to be guided.

-   The customers feel that the process of onboarding is excessively
    time-consuming and confusing.

-   They do not necessarily know what to do or what papers to bring. The
    solution needed by the business will involve a faster, simpler, and
    more consistent onboarding process, both among clients and
    employees.

-   Businessmen would like to cut expenses and gain the maximum customer
    satisfaction.

**\*\*Plan to Validate Assumptions\*\***

-   Introduce these assumptions to the client during the first meeting.

-   Ask the client to affirm or redefine every point.

-   Take notes about where the assumptions differ from reality.

-   Update the requirements document based on the client's corrections.

**\## 2. Broken Down Requirements**

From the problems described, the needs can be broken into the following
areas:

**\### A. Employee Onboarding**

-   Create a clear training program for new hires.

-   Reduce the onboarding time from 3 months to something shorter
    (target to be confirmed).

-   Standardize the knowledge and steps so every new hire learns the
    same way.

-   Track employee progress during training.

-   Provide easy access to training resources (manual, digital guides,
    or videos).

**\###** **B. Client Onboarding**

-   Design a standard process for registering new clients and their
    pets.

-   Remove "individual employee flavour" by making sure all staff follow
    the same steps.

-   Collect all required client and pet information in one place.

-   Facilitate the process for the customers, such as providing
    easy-to-follow instructions, preferably via the internet.

-   On Onboarding: Confirm medical history and vaccination.

**\### C. Customer Experience**

-   Have straightforward and clear instructions for new customers.

-   Notify customers of the subsequent step, e.g., confirmation email,
    items to be brought.

-   Improve onboarding waiting time.

-   Offer communication/help services such as phone, email, or FAQ.

**\### D. Operational Efficiency**

-   Reduce employee frustration by making processes simple.

-   Document **\*\*standard operating procedures (SOPs)\*\*** for staff.

-   Use tools or systems that reduce manual work.

-   Improve consistency across employees and customer interactions.

**\### E. Mapping Problems to Requirements**

-   The owner is concerned because the standard onboarding of an
    > employee takes 3 months; therefore, it is necessary to develop an
    > educational program, streamline the onboarding process, and save
    > time.

-   The frustration of employees is contained in the fact that everyone
    > has his/her flavour of client onboarding, and, therefore, it is
    > necessary to create a unified onboarding checklist and train
    > personnel and establish SOPs.

-   The problem of customer frustration can be explained by the fact
    > that the onboarding process is enigmatic and hard to follow; thus,
    > the need to simplify the process of registering a customer, give
    > adequate instructions, create customer-friendly guides, and
    > utilize communication templates is to be fulfilled.

**\## 3. Questions for the Client**

**\### General Business Questions**

-   What is your vision of an "ideal onboarding process" for both
    employees and clients?

-   What is the number of new employees and new customers that you
    normally onboard monthly?

-   Do you currently use any onboarding software, and is it mostly
    paper/manual?

-   What are the largest expenses (time or money) in your existing
    onboarding procedures?

**\### Employee Onboarding Questions**

-   Which parts of training take the most time for new employees to
    learn?

-   Do you have training manuals or videos already, or do staff teach in
    their own way?

-   How do you decide when an employee is "ready" to work independently?

-   Do you want digital training (like e-learning) or in-person only?

**\### Client Onboarding Questions**

-   What steps does a new customer currently go through when registering
    their pet?

-   What do customers most complain about in the process?

-   Would you prefer customers to be registered online or in person, or
    both?

-   What details do you need to obtain about new customers, e.g., pet
    medical history, emergency contact?

> \-\--

**\## 4. Follow-Up Clarification Questions**

These are questions I expect to arise once I know more details:

-   Should employee onboarding include online learning modules or just
    printed material?

-   Would you like to allow the customer to do their registration from
    the comfort of home, or should it be done at the daycare centre?

-   Are there legal or compliance standards, like pet vaccinations or
    waivers, that should always be present?

-   Would you like to monitor customer satisfaction as a part of the new
    onboarding flow?

-   Should employees receive regular refresh training after onboarding?

-   How will success be measured? (Examples: reduced training time,
    fewer customer complaints, more positive reviews).

**\##** **5. Preliminary Tasks**

**\###** **Employee Onboarding Tasks**

-   Establish and report on the employee onboarding workflow.

-   Gather and prepare training materials.

-   Create a digital/printed employee training manual.

    as a brochure, web page, or frequently asked questions.

-   Add support/help channels for customers.

-   Test the process with pilot customers to ensure it is simple.

**\### Operational Efficiency Tasks**

**\## 6. Git Commit Strategy**

To stay organized, commits will follow best practices:

Use Conventional Commit format:

\- \`feat: \` for new features → e.g., \`feat: add standardized client
registration form\`

\- \`fix: \` for bug fixes → e.g., \`fix: correct validation for
vaccination field\`

\- \`docs: \` for documentation → e.g., \`docs: add employee onboarding
SOP draft\`

\- \`chore: \` for non-functional tasks → e.g., \`chore: update readme
with setup instructions\`

**\*\*Example\*\***

\- \`docs: add initial project assumptions\`

\- \`docs: add broken down requirements for onboarding improvements\`

\- \`docs: add client questions and clarification points\`

\- \`feat: define preliminary tasks for employee and client onboarding\`

\- \`docs: add git commit strategy with examples\`

\- \`chore: update project documentation with next steps\`

**\*\*Commit Rules: \*\***

-   One change per commit (no mixed changes).

-   Speak in the imperative (e.g., add not added).

-   Make commits small and frequent.

-   It is advisable to mention the task/ need in the commit message.

**\## 7. Next Steps**

1\. Identify assumptions about the client and validate/refute them.

2\. Identify the onboarding process (employee or customer) that needs to
be addressed first.

3\. Gather specifications during the following client meeting.

4\. Begin with the simple, readily achievable changes when developing
the long-term solutions.
