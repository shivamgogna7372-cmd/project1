**Assignment 1: Getting Organized - Pet Daycare Project**

**1\. Assumptions**

- The daycare uses manual processes for employee and client onboarding.
- Employee training is inconsistent and takes about 3 months.
- Customers find onboarding confusing and slow.
- The business wants faster, simpler, standardized processes.

**Plan:** Validate assumptions in the first client meeting using a checklist, confirm or correct them, then update requirements.

**2\. Broken Down Requirements**

**\*\*\\### A. Employee Onboarding\*\***  
- Create a clear training program for new hires.  
Decrease onboarding time from 3 months to less than that (target will be established).
Make the resources of training (manual, digital guides, or videos) readily available.  

**\*\*###\*\* \*\*B. Client Onboarding\*\***  
- Design a standard process for registering new clients and their pets.  
- Collect all required client and pet information in one place.  
- Make it simple for the customers, like giving instructions that are easy to follow, and preferably through the internet.  

**\*\*\\### C. Customer Experience\*\***  
- Have straightforward and clear instructions for new customers.  
- Notify customers of the subsequent step, e.g., confirmation email, items to be brought.  

<br/>**\*\*\\### D. Operational Efficiency\*\***  
- Reduce employee frustration by making processes simple.  
- Document \*\*\\\*\*standard operating procedures (SOPs)\\*\*\* for staff.  

**3\. Key Questions**

**\*\*\\### General Business Questions\*\***  
- What is the number of new employees and new customers that you normally onboard monthly?  
- Do you currently use any onboarding software, and is it mostly paper/manual?

**\*\*\\### Employee Onboarding Questions\*\***  
- What are the time-consuming areas of training new employees?

Do you already have training manuals/videos, or do staff train in their own manner?

When do you know that an employee is ready to operate independently?

**  
\*\*\\### Client Onboarding Questions\*\***  
- What steps does a new customer currently go through when registering their pet?  
- What do customers most complain about in the process?  
- Would you prefer customers to be registered online or in person, or both?  

<br/>**4\. Follow-Up Clarifications**

- Should onboarding include digital training modules or printed material?

- Should there be online and offline bookings made by clients or not? 

- Are they under compliance (e.g., vaccinations, waivers)?

- How are exceptions handled (aggressive pets, missing paperwork)?

- Which parts of the process frustrate customers the most?

**5\. Preliminary Tasks**

 - Map the current client onboarding process

- Map the current employee onboarding process

- Collect existing forms and training materials

- Draft standard client onboarding checklist and employee training checklist

- Create an FAQ for clients and staff

- Pilot the new process

- Gather feedback and refine

**6\. Git Commit Strategy**

**Use Conventional Commits:**

feat: new features (e.g., feat: add client registration form).

fix: bug fixes (e.g., fix: correct vaccination validation).

docs: documentation updates.

chore: non-functional updates.

**Examples:**

- docs: add assumptions
- feat: add onboarding checklist
- docs: add client questions

**Rules:** one change per commit, imperative mood, small and frequent.

**7\. Next Steps**

- Validate assumptions with the client.
- Confirm priority (employee vs. client).
- Start with small improvements first.
